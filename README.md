# Project Name

goursh is a Go URL shortener and bookmarking system. The system shortens URLs to unique alphanumeric strings, with link visit statistics, as well as providing basic bookmarking capabilities with hierarchical categorization.

## Installation

Currently, you will need to have a working [Go 1.7+](https://golang.org/) installation on your system. Assuming you have that prerequisite taken care of, then get the package with:

```
go get -u github.com/bigangryguy/goursh
```

You will also need a MySQL or MariaDB database accessible from the system where goursh will be run. MariaDB was used to develop goursh, but goursh does not use any features that aren't also compatible with MySQL.

## Usage

Coming soon - goursh is still in development.
